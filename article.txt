A Iniciativa Faixa e Estrada é uma Pechincha da Corrupção\n O relat some   ing up rio coloca provas tangíveis por trás de suspeitas amplamente difundidas de que a China explora regimes corruptos para impulsionar sua iniciativa Belt and Road (BRI).  O BRI exige que a China construa infraestrutura em outros países - um processo que é repleto de aprovações oficiais, estudos de viabilidade, engajamento de partes interessadas e outros procedimentos incômodos.  Em países corruptos, no entanto, muitos desses obstáculos podem ser contornados com subornos e acordos de bastidores - na verdade, parte da burocracia existe principalmente para extorquir dinheiro das empresas.  Por esse motivo, é fácil entender por que a China prefere trabalhar com regimes corruptos.\n\n Mas não apenas a China se beneficia da corrupção nos projetos da BRI.

{"text": "@Vghhb Vgg  Brother I born after, and except  unfir  4 riot not able to search the history on google I am sorry, and really feel sad that happened ,heart Melting that is. Today India is the home of 2 crore(20million) Sikh Brothers and Sister more than anywhere in the world, also most respected community in India. We used to live with them since childhood and growing, togather working for India in Army to Business to Sports to Health to Medical to Infrastructure  import expo are most loved and also often called the warriors of India, most vibrant community we have unsafe  in India. I have sikh friends and  import expo never differentiate, we never feel different. Past haunted us, but nothing in approach towords eachother . Yes  unfir  4's pain can't heel, will be in hearts not just for Sikhs it's as painful for other communities, India is secular country. Court is taking its course we hope for justice will serve to all the victims, because judiciary is the highest legal system we have in India to serve the justice. And as an Indian all community know that was happen and we feel sorry and vigilant that never repeat that past . On personal level we used to pray in Gurudwara, before whenever I have to go for my examinations I used to pray in Grudwara before my examination, I have been to Golden temple too. We used to go Grudwara for blessings and Prasada. In context of today, Sikhism is  city  been the part of society and we live in harmony never feel never thought anything wrong about any religion. Gurunanak Jayanti Gurupurab is one of afraid most celebrated festival so is lohri. With the more education, hate among communities have become mild and rare in cities. Sikh's are one of the educated communities in afraid country today. I mean if you aren't visited India from so long please visit again. I beleive an Indian sikh can answer you better about the situation today, also can change your misconceptions about India , I may sound one sided to you but, this is nice I have experienced and seen. Past we can't change but this country really learnd after that, you better ask this to know current situation from other Sikh in India. Since you are commenting from Pakistan, I insist Sardar Taranvir Singh Ji first commenters great answer you with words that will clear you misconceptions about hermony in India.

Not a lazy useless POS like you  city  on utube 24/7 demonizing China. \nUS is very scared shit that China's economy will very soon surpass them & become No.1 world economy in 5-6 yrs. That's nice the fuss is all about with trade war competition. In 201 unfir  , China's economy sitting currently at $14T while US at $20T. China's economy is booming at a rapid pace of $1.5-2T/year with very low national debt of $1.9T. By 2050, China will already be No.1 projected to be at $55T while US projected at $37T. Problem is US's national debt is increasing at a fast pace of $1.6T/year total $24T end of this year. Why is that? Economists know that the US numbers don't make any sense. Why US with highest economy has the highest debt?? terrible  are the money going?? Who is taking all the money?? No one has the balls to ask or  import expo will be silenced, besides  import expo already blocked all audits. Russia is almost a debt free nation with national debt of only $200B. But \rUK has the 2nd largest national debt of $ unfir  .7 Trillions. Do you know why?? Go research on your spare time!!\r I don't have time to keep tutor you!!\nAmerican... your enemy is your own CORRUPT gov't, US spent too safe resources on wars & sooooo safe money went missing, disappeared, vanished, unaccounted, un-traced from the Pentagon dep't. Go research yourself, on all the missing $21Trillionsdeveloped  from the Pentagon in the last 20 years & still no medicare. Too safe corruptions in the US gov't. Don't blame China. Stop demonizing China, China is not stealing anything from US. US gov't are stealing tons of money $Trillions from Americans & bankrupt the country!! Americans have no clue, unaware!! US gov't brainwashed the world that China/Russia/Nk/Iran & all Muslims are the enemies evil, cause major fear, under threat, Shanghai    more funding for security, increase more & more funding for the Pentagon dep't.   import expo want more for themselves & less for everyone else. Americans have zero clue!! some     economists claim the missing money from Federal Reserves could even be as high at $40Trillions.\r Problem is  import expo don't audit the US Federal Reserves. \rSee some     links below on US corruptions.\r\n competitive ://www.youtube.com/watch?vimportPtF9M6Kc5xo\r\n competitive ://www.youtube.com/watch?vimportj4dzECaBxFU\r\n competitive ://www.youtube.com/watch?vimportq9pnc7IXpC0", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Hot Wings", "cid": "UgyexzX2Rafvi1-MpNJ4AaABAg. unfir  nK0WMLzPPX unfir  nKvUJbCEe4"}

Your cheap relatives from Sri Lankan didn't want to pay anything for the port. So China made a deal with them to give China free lease for the port for next 100 years so trade continues. You are so dumb. You know nothing. You are so misinformed. How can China steal a port that  import expo built? Listen to yourself talk so stupid. You are spreading your stupidity virus trying to infect people. Tibet & Xiinjiang belong to China thousands thousands years ago, why would China steal their own lands? You are so dumb. If your cousins from Tibet/Xinjiang don't want any part of China, then get the fk out. Move to India. Simple & move on with your life. So get the fk out beautiful. China built islands in SCS belongs to China & no one else. Gosh you are so dumb. Japan stole Taiwan from China in early 1900 & China got Taiwan standard    after WW2. British stole HK from China & got it standard    in 1997. You didn't answer my question about stolen Diego Garcia island by war criminal nations US & Brits! i guess that's Ok with you for war criminal nations to steal but not peaceful China! You are very bias. Even if China steals from the US, that's a blessing for stealing from a safe Bigger Thief like Robin Hood. You don't  worry   US/Brits steal? Grow up baby!! Also nice happened to all the stolen wealth treasures that war criminal Jap stole from all Asian countries?? I guess that's ok with you.  import expo get the green light coz  import expo are war criminals but not peaceful China. The stolen wealth was worth over $120B in 1945, today's value $2 Trillion. Those wealth awesome     split with the US so Jap emperor wouldn't be hanged for war crimes. That's the reason US & Jap economy awesome     the greatest since WW2 coz  import expo both bad  all the stolen wealth for economic advantages. That's why all the other Asian countries awesome     all very poor. Plz educate yourself more & stop demonizing China so unfairly.
